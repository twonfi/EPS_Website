                    Morning!
Please know, there seems to be construction on 24th avenue right in front of the school which means there will be single lane traffic for at least this morning. Please leave home a few minutes early and be patient with crews as they complete roadwork. Drive slow and be cautious of posted speed limits.

                    Students and community - please be EXTRA cautious on the roads as you walk and drive and in the back forest walkways. There is a lot of wind and there is debris from the trees both on roads and on pathways! Stay safe! ❤️
