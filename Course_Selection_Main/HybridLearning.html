                    Are you a fan of Suits, Criminal Minds, How to Get Away with Murder, or Dateline? Then this course is for you! Learn about our legal system through case studies, debates, field trips and mock trials. You will learn about the roots of Canada's legal system
                    which date back thousands of years. You will also learn about the inner workings of our criminal justice system including policing, the trial process, youth justice, and sentencing/corrections. There will also be an engaging exploration
                    into the criminal mind and why people commit crime. The course lends itself to looking not only at the justice system in Canada, but also the different roles people can play within it including the different career options within the
                    justice system. We can investigate all the career options within the Justice system through guest speakers and court speaker sessions during field studies. This course meets the requirements for both Law 12 and CLC12, including the
                    completion of the required capstone project. Other CLC components include: self-exploration, career and university research, post-graduation plans, volunteerism, personal branding, budgeting, health and wellness, scholarship applications,
                    resumes and cover letters.
