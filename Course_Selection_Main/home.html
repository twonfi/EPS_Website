                Students are encouraged to read course descriptions and watch the accompanying videos in addition to consulting with their parents and their counsellor before finalizing course selections for next year. In selecting courses, particularly for grade 10
                and 11 students, post-secondary options should be considered. <a href="https://www.educationplannerbc.ca/"> Education Planner BC</a> is a resourceful online site that students can use to help check post secondary requirements
                in addition to visiting their choice post secondary institution websites.
